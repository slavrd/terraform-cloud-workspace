  # Terraform Cloud/Enterprise create workspace

  A module to create a simple Terraform Cloud / Enterprise workspace.
  
  Currently the module only manages the name of the workspace, the terraform version and the variables.
  
  ## Usage
  
  An example tf code that uses the module is placed in the `example/` directory. 
  
  In addition to using the module the example code also demonstrates the use of a `template_file` data source to output the needed backend configuration for using the managed workspace.
